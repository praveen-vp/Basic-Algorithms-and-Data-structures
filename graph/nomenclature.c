"Graph" ===>
			A graph is a collection of vertices and edges.

Edge ====>
""""""		An edge is a connection between two vertices.One can draw 
		a graph by making points for the vertices and drawing is defined
		independently of the representation.

Vertices ===>
"""""""""

Tree is graph with no cycles

"Spanning Tree" of a graph is a subgraph with all nodes 
and not all connections.

GraphS with all edges present are called Complete Graph.

Graphs with all edges present are called sparse, less than v log v.

And graphs with relatively few of the possible edges missing are called dense.

unidirected graph
