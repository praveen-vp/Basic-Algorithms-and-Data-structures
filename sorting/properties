=>>> Selection sort : Uses about (n2)/2 comparisons and n exchanges.

			The only part of the selection sort that does depends
		on the input is the number of times min is updated. In the 
		worst case, this could be quadratic, but in the average 
		case, this quantity turns out to be only "O(n log n)", so we
		can expect the running time of selection sort to be quite
		insensitive to the input.

=>>> Insertion Sort : Uses about (N2)/4 comparisons and (N2/8) exchanges
		on an average, twice as many in the worst case.

=>>> Bubble Sort : Uses (N2)/2 comparisons and (N2)/2 exchanges on the 
		average, and in the worst case.

=>>> Insertion Sort : Is linear for "almost sorted" list...

=>>> Selection Sort is linear for files with large records and small keys.
